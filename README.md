## Download
Download the files and open Interface.py. Here you type your code in there and run it here only. The actual coding is in the main.py file, check out the file and fork this repository to add your own functions 
> Note: Make sure that you run this in a python window, because keep in mind that the language is based upon python and runs python, so follow basic rules and syntax for it.

### Explantion of the Code
So essiantly the main.py Python file creates a tkinter user window, and then the user inputs inside there through he form of a text box. They can save the file to their Computer and then having permanent storage. You can also link this to an external hard drive. And ther eis a run button which for now is presented on the form of the Python Shell program, in the future there will be a better UI and also  put the output on the Tkinter window itself.
And the Program.go file contains the nesscary UTF-8 encoding along with the defualt settings in a data file.
